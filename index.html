        <h2 class="center">WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE LIVING?</h2>
        <p>Sustainable living is a lifestyle that aims to reduce one’s
            environmental impact, in ways that are sustainable both for the Earth
            and for the person. So while pledging to never run your faucet again may
            be sustainable for the planet, it probably wouldn’t be sustainable for
            you personally (or for your friends who would be subject to your poor
            hygiene).</p>
            <p>There are endless ways to live sustainably, including: reducing your use
                of resources, composting, relying on clean energy sources, reducing your
                consumption of single-use plastic, eating less animal products, shopping
                for clothing and other items sustainably, buying local, and more</p>
    </div>
<h3 class="center">How to start Sustainable Living?</h3>
<p>There are numerous ways to start living more sustainably — and a
    sustainable lifestyle looks different for everyone. Areas where you can
    reduce your impact include:</p>
<table>
    <tr>
       <th>Eating a Plant-based Diet</th>
        <th>Composting</th>
        <th>Reducing Single-Use Plastic</th>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p>
                Animal products like meat, dairy, and eggs are the highest-impact
                foods on Earth. To lower your diet’s footprint, consider
                transitioning to a vegan diet, or at least eating more vegan
                meals. Along with this, it’s important to focus on wasting less
                food. 
            </p>
        </td>
        <td>
            <p>Instead of sending food scraps (that includes things like
                vegetable peels, avocado pits, and spoiled leftovers) to landfill,
                start composting. Composting is the process of returning anything
                that comes from nature to the earth, and letting it biodegrade
                into soil. Setting up a compost bin is super easy if you have a
                backyard, but it’s also possible if you live in an apartment or in
                a city with no yard.</p>
        </td>
        <td>
            <p>Reducing single-use plastic is important for several reasons:

                Environmental impact: Single-use plastics have a significant impact on the environment. They are often not disposed of properly and end up in the ocean or other natural environments where they can harm wildlife and pollute ecosystems. Reducing single-use plastic can help prevent these negative effects.
                
                Carbon footprint: The production, transportation, and disposal of single-use plastic contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. Reducing single-use plastic can help lower carbon emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
                
                Health concerns: Some single-use plastics, such as water bottles and food packaging, can release harmful chemicals into the products they contain, which can be harmful to human health. By reducing single-use plastic, we can help reduce our exposure to these chemicals.
                
                Resource conservation: The production of single-use plastic requires significant amounts of resources, such as oil and water. Reducing single-use plastic can help conserve these resources and reduce our overall environmental impact.
                
                Cost savings: Reducing single-use plastic can also save money. By using reusable alternatives, such as water bottles and shopping bags, we can reduce the amount of money we spend on disposable products over time.</p>

    <h2 class="center">WHAT PEOPLE CAN DO?</h2>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>
            <h3>Grow Foods</h3>
            <p>Growing some of your own food. Start a vegetable or herb garden, and
                plant a fruit tree or even two. This will save tonnes of transport
                greenhouse gases because the food will be right outside your door.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>insulate houses</h3>
            <p>Insulate houses to reduce the amount of energy needed to heat and
                cool the house. Trees planted around the house will shade it during
                hot weather.</p>
                <p>
                    Some people are coveringroof with living plants to stop the house warming or cooling too quickly

        <li>
            <h3> Use Public transport</h3>
            <p>Use public transport whenever you can to reduce the amount of gases
                from petrol powered cars. Ride your bike!</p>
